# k-detector
The k-detector is a facial recognition welcome hack friday app running on a Raspberry Pi. Using facial recognition technology the app will be able to welcome anyone walking into the room and provide them with a relevant welcoming message and any other information that the person may need.

## Cool feature ideas
* Link up to Outlook calendar to provide info on meetings to be had on the day
* Reminder ability for TODOs on the day
* Welcome visitors and ask who they are so we can welcome them again next time they visit
